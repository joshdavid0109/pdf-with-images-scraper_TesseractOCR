The KASAMA/SSC plays a vital role in the promotion of the general welfare and the
uplift of the fundamental student rights and duties. It is autonomous and the authority
emanates from the students. The SLU KASAMA/SSC is composed of three branches,
namely Executive Committee, Student Court and Congress of Louisians; and two
constitutional commissions, namely Commission on Elections and Commission on
Audit. They have a Constitution and By-Laws that govern their tasks and funding in the
form of KASAMA/SSC student fees for their operation and project implementation. The
SLU KASAMA/SSC President seats as a committee member in several Administrative
Committees whereby student participation is merited.https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=808357307995669&set=a.474694611361942

  The Union of Faculty and Employees of Saint Louis
University (UFESLU) was issued its Certificate of
Registration by the Bureau of Labor Relations on
July 15, 1987. The Union was initiated by a group of
dedicated workers who acknowledged the need for
reforms amidst the changing times. UFESLU aims to
represent the faculty and employees of Saint Louis
University in collective bargaining for salaries, wages,
hours of work, and other terms and conditions of
employment. Moreover, it aims to promote the
moral, 
social, 
and 
economic 
well-being 
and
individual and collective rights of all the members.
Guided by the Christian educational institution, it
fosters 
harmonious 
and 
progressive 
labor-
management relations among its members. It has
strived to adopt legislations, policies, and other
measures that benefit the members for thirty-five
years. 
     The union members are encouraged to be
involved in matters that directly and indirectly affect
them. Throughout the existence of the Union, it has
promoted pro- labor policies and people power
intending to transform the labor group into a more
dynamic organization. One of its significant practices
is 
its 
conduct 
of 
the 
Collective 
Bargaining
Agreement, wherein the employees are encouraged
to take an active part in making decisions. UNIVERSITY UNION

Victoria P. Dines, OIC of CJ Moran Community Legal Assistance Office/CLEP
Director, and Ms. Rebecca L. Palabrica, Accountant III of SLU’s Finance Office-
Accounting Section.
By attending the training, Atty. Dines and Ms. Palabrica were able to increase
their knowledge regarding project management principles and methodologies.
They were also able to learn as well as share best practices in managing access to
justice projects or programs. This knowledge gained by Atty. Dines and Ms.
Palabrica would surely benefit Saint Louis University and its School of Law in its
access to justice project or program planning and implementation.

The School Research and Innovation Councils (SRICs)

Each school has its own Research and Innovation Council, chaired by the respective School
Dean. This includes as members the Undergraduate Research and Innovation Coordinator
(UGRIC), Faculty Research and Innovation Promoter (FRIP), the Graduate Program Coordinator
(GPC), and the Heads of the various School Departments. In schools where there are no
research units or graduate programs, two or three other faculty or administrative staff members
may be designated as Council members.

The SRICs act as the focal bodies for promoting research and innovation undertakings at the
school levels, and thus serve a vital role in the furtherance of the University Research and
Innovation Agenda. In this regard, each SRIC develops its own School Research and Innovation
Agenda (i.e., what it aims to achieve in terms of research and innovation, and in what area/s
does it intend to contribute) as well as Action Plan (i.e., mechanisms and strategies by which to
achieve its research objectives). Each SRIC is given a free hand on how to go about its tasks,
including the generation, if possible, of financial support for its own research initiatives or the
linking up with other groups for collaborative research and the enhancement of research
capabilities.

     The Chief Justice Moran Community
Legal Assistance Office is the official Legal
Aid Clinic of Saint Louis University. For
more than five years now, the CJ Moran
office has been dedicated to offering free
legal services to the Louisian community
and 
the 
larger 
Cordilleran 
population.
During the pandemic, the CJ Moran office
served the community with free online legal
services and consultations. During the past
three years, the office's services have
significantly impacted the community. Aside
from online services, the office has also
paved the way for online webinars that
promote awareness about individual rights,
such as women's rights, rights with small
claims, and rights of children, to name a few.        
     Furthermore, during the election, the
office 
significantly 
contributed 
to 
the
voters' awareness of their rights and
responsibilities. 
The 
CJ 
Moran 
Legal
Assistance Office has genuinely impacted
the community by providing free legal
assistance and other legal services. At
present, the office continuously offers
these services to the community. Thus,
these programs and services have been fully
supported by Saint Louis University.

   The Saint Louis University Supreme Student Council, in
partnership with Commission on Elections, launched the
Voter's Education Series on March 5, 2022. As the country
faces the impact of the health crisis brought about by the
pandemic, partnered with the growing economic crisis, the
student body acknowledges that the youth's active
participation in the country's political activities is needed.
Thus, the Voter's Education Series was launched. The
activity encourages youth to assess the candidates and
their respective political platforms. The end goal is to vote
for the candidate with the best platform for the country.
The activity was graced by the former Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of the Philippines, Maria Lourdes Sereno.
The Youth Coordinator of Tamaka accompanied her,
Tamang Kandidato sa Eleksyon, Mr. James Rodriguez. The
Education Series was conducted via Zoom and was
streamed via Facebook.

On August 17, 2023, the BCJZ held the first of its series of training workshop on the
Katarungang Pambarangay Law.

Hon. Judge Ruth B. Bawayan of the MTCC Branch 6 of Baguio City formally opened
the activity highlighting the important role of the barangays as part of the
alternative dispute mechanism of our justice system.

This was followed by discussions on the principles of and procedures laid down by
the KPL by Atty. Jonathan P. Bosantog of the Public Attorney's Office (Regional
Office)

Participants then underwent a workshop which facilitated the merging of theory and
praxis as they were confronted with scenarios that needed the application of those
discussed during the lecture.

Indigenous Peoples (IPs) and Indigenous Peoples Mandatory Representatives
(IPMRs) from different provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR)
gathered in Le Monet Hotel, Baguio City for the 3-day Training on Processes
Involving Indigenous Peoples’ Rights.

On the first day of the Training, the participants had a breakout session to talk about
the issues and concerns of each province with regard to IP rights and they shared
these during the plenary session. In the afternoon, Atty. Arthur Herman and Atty.
Claude Mia Tupeng of the NCIP had a discussion on CADTs, CALTs, and boundary
disputes, after which the participants raised their queries through the open forum.

It was indeed a fruitful first day of the 3-day Training!

The School Research and Innovation Councils (SRICs)

Each school has its own Research and Innovation Council, chaired by the respective School
Dean. This includes as members the Undergraduate Research and Innovation Coordinator
(UGRIC), Faculty Research and Innovation Promoter (FRIP), the Graduate Program Coordinator
(GPC), and the Heads of the various School Departments. In schools where there are no
research units or graduate programs, two or three other faculty or administrative staff members
may be designated as Council members.

The SRICs act as the focal bodies for promoting research and innovation undertakings at the
school levels, and thus serve a vital role in the furtherance of the University Research and
Innovation Agenda. In this regard, each SRIC develops its own School Research and Innovation
Agenda (i.e., what it aims to achieve in terms of research and innovation, and in what area/s
does it intend to contribute) as well as Action Plan (i.e., mechanisms and strategies by which to
achieve its research objectives). Each SRIC is given a free hand on how to go about its tasks,
including the generation, if possible, of financial support for its own research initiatives or the
linking up with other groups for collaborative research and the enhancement of research
capabilities.

     The KASAMA/SSC plays a vital role in the promotion of the general welfare and the
uplift of the fundamental student rights and duties. It is autonomous and the authority
emanates from the students. The SLU KASAMA/SSC is composed of three branches,
namely Executive Committee, Student Court and Congress of Louisians; and two
constitutional commissions, namely Commission on Elections and Commission on
Audit. They have a Constitution and By-Laws that govern their tasks and funding in the
form of KASAMA/SSC student fees for their operation and project implementation. The
SLU KASAMA/SSC President seats as a committee member in several Administrative
Committees whereby student participation is merited.

potential impact of any relevant needs and expectations that may be elicited from the

   The Saint Louis University Supreme Student Council, in
partnership with Commission on Elections, launched the
Voter's Education Series on March 5, 2022. As the country
faces the impact of the health crisis brought about by the
pandemic, partnered with the growing economic crisis, the
student body acknowledges that the youth's active
participation in the country's political activities is needed.
Thus, the Voter's Education Series was launched. The
activity encourages youth to assess the candidates and
their respective political platforms. The end goal is to vote
for the candidate with the best platform for the country.
The activity was graced by the former Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of the Philippines, Maria Lourdes Sereno.
The Youth Coordinator of Tamaka accompanied her,
Tamang Kandidato sa Eleksyon, Mr. James Rodriguez. The
Education Series was conducted via Zoom and was
streamed via Facebook.

  The Union of Faculty and Employees of Saint Louis
University (UFESLU) was issued its Certificate of
Registration by the Bureau of Labor Relations on July
15, 1987. The Union was initiated by a group of
dedicated workers who acknowledged the need for
reforms amidst the changing times. UFESLU aims to
represent the faculty and employees of Saint Louis
University in collective bargaining for salaries, wages,
hours of work, and other terms and conditions of
employment. Moreover, it aims to promote the
moral, 
social, 
and 
economic 
well-being 
and
individual and collective rights of all the members.
Guided by the Christian educational institution, it
fosters 
harmonious 
and 
progressive 
labor-
management relations among its members. It has
strived to adopt legislations, policies, and other
measures that benefit the members for thirty-five
years. 
     The union members are encouraged to be
involved in matters that directly and indirectly affect
them. Throughout the existence of the Union, it has
promoted pro- labor policies and people power
intending to transform the labor group into a more
dynamic organization. One of its significant practices
is 
its 
conduct 
of 
the 
Collective 
Bargaining
Agreement, wherein the employees are encouraged
to take an active part in making decisions.

The emphasis on community health and wellness at Saint Louis University
is rooted in a Louisian's unwavering duty and overall commitment to love
and serve their communities, or ""Amare et Servire."" A Lousian's Human
Agency for volunteerism is enabled by this call for well-being. The delivery
of health outreach programs that aim to improve and promote wellness
strategies such as physical and mental hygiene, nutrition, family planning,
health monitoring, and other health related activities exemplifies the
embodiment of the core value of Social Involvement. 
Furthermore, Saint Louis University empowers students to take a stand and
make a difference in the call for globalized positive health and welfare
through various health outreach programs. This empowerment can be seen
in the realized impact of the various programs offered in various local
communities. Certainly, SLU's collaboration with its students and local
communities has created opportunities for disadvantaged people to
receive necessary health care services.

One of the goals of Saint Louis University is to amplify its commitment to
society that resonates through the services it provides to its stakeholders.
SLU’s dedication to community service engages external partners to
utilize its facilities and expertise in times of need. In recent years, SLU did
not hesitate to open its doors to assist local government units in planning,
initiating, and implementing strategies to meet the necessities of the
general population. During the pandemic, SLU partnered with the local
government to provide a venue that serves as a vaccination center for the
people of Baguio City. 
True to being one with society, SLU’s initiatives significantly impacted the
city's recovery. Embracing and becoming an embodiment of social

 Maternal and child nursing (MCN) and Community health nursing
(CHN) are vital subjects in nursing education that equip students
with the knowledge and skills essential for addressing the
multifaceted realm of sexual and reproductive health. MCN
highlights the concept that empowers students to make informed
decisions, practice safe sex, foster healthy relationships, and
understand diverse sexual identities while reducing unintended
pregnancies, STIs, and promoting mental well-being and emotional
safety. Moreover, community health nursing highlights the different
programs offered by the government along with preventive
healthcare, with a strong focus on family planning, vaccinations, and
health education. Nursing students are trained to engage and
educate families in the care process, acknowledging that family
dynamics often play a critical role in sexual and reproductive health
decisions. All in all, MCN and CHN courses arm students with the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to reproductive health care
that they can use not only for themselves but also for the client/s
they serve.

Together with the increasing number of students/pupils being accommodated for
counseling or other interventions, are other tasks that the counselors/school
psychologists need to attend to, which may contribute to the experience of burnout. 
Often, after handling difficult cases, Saint Louis University's counselors/school
psychologists need to process their feelings or emotions with a colleague or, as is
most often the case, on their own. Hence, the university has been conducting monthly
peer supervision sessions which provide an avenue for counselors/school
psychologists to discuss unique cases, objectively assess how these are handled, and
learn from the best practices of their peers.
Also, it gives an opportunity for counselors/school psychologists to realize
commonality of experiences and establish a strong support for each other.

by Huachiew Chalermprakiet University, where they immersed
themselves in the practice of Medical Laboratory Science. This unique
opportunity allowed them to gain invaluable insights into world-class
transfusion medicine procedures and explore diverse community
health outcomes. During their visits to local communities, they
experienced firsthand the varied health conditions affecting different
populations, deepening their understanding of the critical role they
will play in improving healthcare on a broader scale. This hands-on
experience not only enriched their education but also ignited their
passion for making a meaningful impact in the field of health.
This collaboration between SLU and Huachiew Chalermprakiet
University reflects a shared commitment to enhancing healthcare
education and fostering international partnerships. By exposing
interns to real-world applications of their studies, both institutions are
preparing the next generation of healthcare professionals to meet the
challenges of modern medicine.
As health education continues to evolve, initiatives like this not only
strengthen academic ties but also promote a deeper understanding of
essential health practices that can benefit communities on a global
scale. The experience gained during these visits is expected to inspire
the interns to contribute meaningfully to the healthcare sector upon
their return to their respective universities.

School of Nursing, Allied Health, and Biological Sciences (SONAHBS) and School of Medicine
(SOM) spearheaded the SLU Community Extension and Outreach Program to Persons
Deprived of Liberty (PDL) at the Baguio City Jail on 27th day of November, 2023 with the
theme of “Prison Health is Public Health: Establishing a Regular Health Care Program to
Manage the Health of Persons Deprived of Liberty”. The program was in collaboration with
Regional Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) - CAR and their clinic staff,
alongside with the assistance from Criminology Interns from University of Baguio and
volunteers from Medical Outreach Mission Fellowship Initiative (MOMFI).
GOOD HEALTH

v
The Extension and Outreach Program started as early as 6:00 AM with simultaneous clinical
activities for PDL. Volunteers from the Medical Laboratory Sciences Department took
initiative on facilitating patient registration, specimen collection, and health assessment
headed by the Clinical Laboratory Supervisor (CLS) team. Concurrently, volunteers from the
Nursing Department obtained the vital signs of PDL prior to the consultation proper led by
the SOM, assisted by MOMFI. Laboratory services were also offered such as Pap smear,
KOH (Potassium hydroxide) smear, and ECG. PLD’s prescriptions were filled and endorsed
to the volunteers from the Pharmacy Department to dispense their prescribed medications.
Health assessment forms and collated diagnoses and medical interventions were secured
by the BJMP-CAR for the succeeding phases of the extension program.
Thereafter, in collaboration with Deo-Kid Foundation, founded by Mr. and Mrs. Valdeo gave
early Christmas presents to the PDL yielding joy and hope this season of giving. They
brought entertainment with games and prizes that PLD was in gratitude for. The Deo-Kid
Foundation donated slippers, shoes, bags, and many more in hopes that they will use those
after they serve their sentence inside the Baguio City Jail. “Tsinelas at bag regalo namin sa
inyo kasi gusto namin na ito yung gagamitin ninyo ito sa paglabas niyo,” Mrs. Valdeo added. 
Volunteers also witnessed the creativity of the PDL from their livelihood and hand-crafted
recycled bags and parol which are also available for sale. Christmas is not just about giving
and spreading joy. It is also ensuring that your health is prioritized. The outreach program
taught us that unlike any other tsinelas that are easily worn out, we should have enough
strength to give love that goes beyond an enclosed cell.

 Maternal and child nursing (MCN) and Community health nursing
(CHN) are vital subjects in nursing education that equip students
with the knowledge and skills essential for addressing the
multifaceted realm of sexual and reproductive health. MCN
highlights the concept that empowers students to make informed
decisions, practice safe sex, foster healthy relationships, and
understand diverse sexual identities while reducing unintended
pregnancies, STIs, and promoting mental well-being and emotional
safety. Moreover, community health nursing highlights the different
programs offered by the government along with preventive
healthcare, with a strong focus on family planning, vaccinations, and
health education. Nursing students are trained to engage and
educate families in the care process, acknowledging that family
dynamics often play a critical role in sexual and reproductive health
decisions. All in all, MCN and CHN courses arm students with the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to reproductive health care
that they can use not only for themselves but also for the client/s
they serve.

nding and an opportunity to listen to ourselves as employees of SLU,” she noted. Ms. Sanil expressed hope that the day would inspire employees to return to their workplaces with renewed energy and insight.
The Day of Pause ser
ved as an essential reminder to disconnect from digital distractions and reconnect with oneself and others. By fostering mental, emotional, and physical well-being, the event promoted a sense of balance and harmony in life.

In compliance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 9211 or the “Tobacco Regulation Act of
2003,” Saint Louis University has imposed a total ban on smoking in all buildings, campuses, and
parked cars within the University property, which also includes all affiliates and auxiliary units
located in the Saint Louis University buildings and campuses. This ban covers all employees and
students, and the University administration has imposed sanctions for violations thereof as
embodied in the Student Handbook and the Administrative and Service Personnel Handbook. 
Saint Louis University
Smoke-free Policy
Saint Louis University (SLU) is reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a smoke-free
environment on campus. In a recent announcement, the university emphasized that smoking
and vaping are strictly prohibited within campus grounds, and bringing any tobacco products, e-
cigarettes, or vaping devices onto the premises is also not allowed.
The reminder comes as part of SLU’s ongoing efforts to ensure the health and safety of its
students, faculty, and staff. 
The university's commitment to a smoke-free campus aligns with the Presidential Advisory
dated October 3, 2007, which mandates cooperation during inspections for prohibited items.
SLU encourages all students to comply with this policy and to understand the importance of
maintaining a healthy environment. (See URL:

One of the goals of Saint Louis University is to amplify its commitment to
society that resonates through the services it provides to its stakeholders.
SLU’s dedication to community service engages external partners to
utilize its facilities and expertise in times of need. In recent years, SLU did
not hesitate to open its doors to assist local government units in planning,
initiating, and implementing strategies to meet the necessities of the
general population. During the pandemic, SLU partnered with the local
government to provide a venue that serves as a vaccination center for the
people of Baguio City. 
True to being one with society, SLU’s initiatives significantly impacted the
city's recovery. Embracing and becoming an embodiment of social
involvement, Saint Louis University offers its sports facilities to the public

is rooted in a Louisian's unwavering duty and overall commitment to love

Agency for volunteerism is enabled by this call for well-being. The delivery
of health outreach programs that aim to improve and promote wellness
strategies such as physical and mental hygiene, nutrition, family planning,
health monitoring, and other health related activities exemplifies the
embodiment of the core value of Social Involvement. 
Furthermore, Saint Louis University empowers students to take a stand and
make a difference in the call for globalized positive health and welfare
through various health outreach programs. This empowerment can be seen
in the realized impact of the various programs offered in various local
communities. Certainly, SLU's collaboration with its students and local

Peer Supervision Program
Published in:  SLU Website
at URL: https://www.slu.edu.ph/guidance-counseling/
Together with the increasing number of students/pupils being accommodated for
counseling or other interventions, are other tasks that the counselors/school
psychologists need to attend to, which may contribute to the experience of burnout. 
Often, after handling difficult cases, Saint Louis University's counselors/school
psychologists need to process their feelings or emotions with a colleague or, as is
most often the case, on their own. Hence, the university has been conducting monthly
peer supervision sessions which provide an avenue for counselors/school
psychologists to discuss unique cases, objectively assess how these are handled, and
learn from the best practices of their peers.
Also, it gives an opportunity for counselors/school psychologists to realize
commonality of experiences and establish a strong support for each other.
