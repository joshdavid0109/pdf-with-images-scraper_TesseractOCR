The KASAMA/SSC plays a vital role in the promotion of the general welfare and the
uplift of the fundamental student rights and duties. It is autonomous and the authority
emanates from the students. The SLU KASAMA/SSC is composed of three branches,
namely Executive Committee, Student Court and Congress of Louisians; and two
constitutional commissions, namely Commission on Elections and Commission on
Audit. They have a Constitution and By-Laws that govern their tasks and funding in the
form of KASAMA/SSC student fees for their operation and project implementation. The
SLU KASAMA/SSC President seats as a committee member in several Administrative
Committees whereby student participation is merited.https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=808357307995669&set=a.474694611361942

  The Union of Faculty and Employees of Saint Louis
University (UFESLU) was issued its Certificate of
Registration by the Bureau of Labor Relations on
July 15, 1987. The Union was initiated by a group of
dedicated workers who acknowledged the need for
reforms amidst the changing times. UFESLU aims to
represent the faculty and employees of Saint Louis
University in collective bargaining for salaries, wages,
hours of work, and other terms and conditions of
employment. Moreover, it aims to promote the
moral, 
social, 
and 
economic 
well-being 
and
individual and collective rights of all the members.
Guided by the Christian educational institution, it
fosters 
harmonious 
and 
progressive 
labor-
management relations among its members. It has
strived to adopt legislations, policies, and other
measures that benefit the members for thirty-five
years. 
     The union members are encouraged to be
involved in matters that directly and indirectly affect
them. Throughout the existence of the Union, it has
promoted pro- labor policies and people power
intending to transform the labor group into a more
dynamic organization. One of its significant practices
is 
its 
conduct 
of 
the 
Collective 
Bargaining
Agreement, wherein the employees are encouraged
to take an active part in making decisions. UNIVERSITY UNION

Victoria P. Dines, OIC of CJ Moran Community Legal Assistance Office/CLEP
Director, and Ms. Rebecca L. Palabrica, Accountant III of SLU’s Finance Office-
Accounting Section.
By attending the training, Atty. Dines and Ms. Palabrica were able to increase
their knowledge regarding project management principles and methodologies.
They were also able to learn as well as share best practices in managing access to
justice projects or programs. This knowledge gained by Atty. Dines and Ms.
Palabrica would surely benefit Saint Louis University and its School of Law in its
access to justice project or program planning and implementation.

The School Research and Innovation Councils (SRICs)

Each school has its own Research and Innovation Council, chaired by the respective School
Dean. This includes as members the Undergraduate Research and Innovation Coordinator
(UGRIC), Faculty Research and Innovation Promoter (FRIP), the Graduate Program Coordinator
(GPC), and the Heads of the various School Departments. In schools where there are no
research units or graduate programs, two or three other faculty or administrative staff members
may be designated as Council members.

The SRICs act as the focal bodies for promoting research and innovation undertakings at the
school levels, and thus serve a vital role in the furtherance of the University Research and
Innovation Agenda. In this regard, each SRIC develops its own School Research and Innovation
Agenda (i.e., what it aims to achieve in terms of research and innovation, and in what area/s
does it intend to contribute) as well as Action Plan (i.e., mechanisms and strategies by which to
achieve its research objectives). Each SRIC is given a free hand on how to go about its tasks,
including the generation, if possible, of financial support for its own research initiatives or the
linking up with other groups for collaborative research and the enhancement of research
capabilities.

     The Chief Justice Moran Community
Legal Assistance Office is the official Legal
Aid Clinic of Saint Louis University. For
more than five years now, the CJ Moran
office has been dedicated to offering free
legal services to the Louisian community
and 
the 
larger 
Cordilleran 
population.
During the pandemic, the CJ Moran office
served the community with free online legal
services and consultations. During the past
three years, the office's services have
significantly impacted the community. Aside
from online services, the office has also
paved the way for online webinars that
promote awareness about individual rights,
such as women's rights, rights with small
claims, and rights of children, to name a few.        
     Furthermore, during the election, the
office 
significantly 
contributed 
to 
the
voters' awareness of their rights and
responsibilities. 
The 
CJ 
Moran 
Legal
Assistance Office has genuinely impacted
the community by providing free legal
assistance and other legal services. At
present, the office continuously offers
these services to the community. Thus,
these programs and services have been fully
supported by Saint Louis University.

   The Saint Louis University Supreme Student Council, in
partnership with Commission on Elections, launched the
Voter's Education Series on March 5, 2022. As the country
faces the impact of the health crisis brought about by the
pandemic, partnered with the growing economic crisis, the
student body acknowledges that the youth's active
participation in the country's political activities is needed.
Thus, the Voter's Education Series was launched. The
activity encourages youth to assess the candidates and
their respective political platforms. The end goal is to vote
for the candidate with the best platform for the country.
The activity was graced by the former Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of the Philippines, Maria Lourdes Sereno.
The Youth Coordinator of Tamaka accompanied her,
Tamang Kandidato sa Eleksyon, Mr. James Rodriguez. The
Education Series was conducted via Zoom and was
streamed via Facebook.

On August 17, 2023, the BCJZ held the first of its series of training workshop on the
Katarungang Pambarangay Law.

Hon. Judge Ruth B. Bawayan of the MTCC Branch 6 of Baguio City formally opened
the activity highlighting the important role of the barangays as part of the
alternative dispute mechanism of our justice system.

This was followed by discussions on the principles of and procedures laid down by
the KPL by Atty. Jonathan P. Bosantog of the Public Attorney's Office (Regional
Office)

Participants then underwent a workshop which facilitated the merging of theory and
praxis as they were confronted with scenarios that needed the application of those
discussed during the lecture.

Indigenous Peoples (IPs) and Indigenous Peoples Mandatory Representatives
(IPMRs) from different provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR)
gathered in Le Monet Hotel, Baguio City for the 3-day Training on Processes
Involving Indigenous Peoples’ Rights.

On the first day of the Training, the participants had a breakout session to talk about
the issues and concerns of each province with regard to IP rights and they shared
these during the plenary session. In the afternoon, Atty. Arthur Herman and Atty.
Claude Mia Tupeng of the NCIP had a discussion on CADTs, CALTs, and boundary
disputes, after which the participants raised their queries through the open forum.

It was indeed a fruitful first day of the 3-day Training!

The School Research and Innovation Councils (SRICs)

Each school has its own Research and Innovation Council, chaired by the respective School
Dean. This includes as members the Undergraduate Research and Innovation Coordinator
(UGRIC), Faculty Research and Innovation Promoter (FRIP), the Graduate Program Coordinator
(GPC), and the Heads of the various School Departments. In schools where there are no
research units or graduate programs, two or three other faculty or administrative staff members
may be designated as Council members.

The SRICs act as the focal bodies for promoting research and innovation undertakings at the
school levels, and thus serve a vital role in the furtherance of the University Research and
Innovation Agenda. In this regard, each SRIC develops its own School Research and Innovation
Agenda (i.e., what it aims to achieve in terms of research and innovation, and in what area/s
does it intend to contribute) as well as Action Plan (i.e., mechanisms and strategies by which to
achieve its research objectives). Each SRIC is given a free hand on how to go about its tasks,
including the generation, if possible, of financial support for its own research initiatives or the
linking up with other groups for collaborative research and the enhancement of research
capabilities.

     The KASAMA/SSC plays a vital role in the promotion of the general welfare and the
uplift of the fundamental student rights and duties. It is autonomous and the authority
emanates from the students. The SLU KASAMA/SSC is composed of three branches,
namely Executive Committee, Student Court and Congress of Louisians; and two
constitutional commissions, namely Commission on Elections and Commission on
Audit. They have a Constitution and By-Laws that govern their tasks and funding in the
form of KASAMA/SSC student fees for their operation and project implementation. The
SLU KASAMA/SSC President seats as a committee member in several Administrative
Committees whereby student participation is merited.

potential impact of any relevant needs and expectations that may be elicited from the

   The Saint Louis University Supreme Student Council, in
partnership with Commission on Elections, launched the
Voter's Education Series on March 5, 2022. As the country
faces the impact of the health crisis brought about by the
pandemic, partnered with the growing economic crisis, the
student body acknowledges that the youth's active
participation in the country's political activities is needed.
Thus, the Voter's Education Series was launched. The
activity encourages youth to assess the candidates and
their respective political platforms. The end goal is to vote
for the candidate with the best platform for the country.
The activity was graced by the former Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of the Philippines, Maria Lourdes Sereno.
The Youth Coordinator of Tamaka accompanied her,
Tamang Kandidato sa Eleksyon, Mr. James Rodriguez. The
Education Series was conducted via Zoom and was
streamed via Facebook.

  The Union of Faculty and Employees of Saint Louis
University (UFESLU) was issued its Certificate of
Registration by the Bureau of Labor Relations on July
15, 1987. The Union was initiated by a group of
dedicated workers who acknowledged the need for
reforms amidst the changing times. UFESLU aims to
represent the faculty and employees of Saint Louis
University in collective bargaining for salaries, wages,
hours of work, and other terms and conditions of
employment. Moreover, it aims to promote the
moral, 
social, 
and 
economic 
well-being 
and
individual and collective rights of all the members.
Guided by the Christian educational institution, it
fosters 
harmonious 
and 
progressive 
labor-
management relations among its members. It has
strived to adopt legislations, policies, and other
measures that benefit the members for thirty-five
years. 
     The union members are encouraged to be
involved in matters that directly and indirectly affect
them. Throughout the existence of the Union, it has
promoted pro- labor policies and people power
intending to transform the labor group into a more
dynamic organization. One of its significant practices
is 
its 
conduct 
of 
the 
Collective 
Bargaining
Agreement, wherein the employees are encouraged
to take an active part in making decisions.
